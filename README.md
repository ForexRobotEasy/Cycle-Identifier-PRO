# Cycle Identifier PRO

Cycle Identifier PRO is a custom indicator developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to enhance trading by analyzing market cycles. This indicator identifies the high and low points of cycles in the market and provides filtered price values for trend analysis.

## Indicator Input Parameters

- `periods` (default: 20): The number of periods to consider when identifying cycles.
- `filterPeriods` (default: 5): The number of periods to use for filtering the cycle values.

## Indicator Initialization

The indicator initialization function `OnInit()` is responsible for setting up the indicator. It sets the indicator name and digit precision, as well as the style and buffer for drawing the trend lines. The `SetIndexDrawBegin()` function is used to set the starting point for drawing the lines.

## Indicator Calculation

The indicator calculation function `OnCalculate()` is called for each new tick to calculate the indicator values. It initializes the trend buffers if it is the first calculation. Then, it iterates through the available data points and identifies the highest and lowest values within the specified number of periods to determine the cycle high and low points. 

The filtered price value is calculated as the average of the cycle high and low. Then, the function calculates the highest and lowest values within the specified number of filter periods to determine the filter high and low points.

Based on the comparison of the filtered price and the filtered value, the function determines whether the current point is in an uptrend or a downtrend. The trend values are assigned to the corresponding trend buffers.
